<p><b><u>ABOUT THE CAVES</b></u></p>
<p> The Ajanta Caves are located in <b>Maharashtra, India.</b> The caves are around 29 rock-cut 
Buddhist cave monuments which date from the 2nd century BCE to about 480 CE.The caves 
include paintings and rock cut sculptures described as among the finest surviving examples 
of ancient Indian art, particularly expressive paintings that present emotion through 
gesture, pose and form. This is a great place to visit because of its rich history and beautiful
art. For more information on the Ajanta Caves, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajanta_Caves">click here.</a></p>

<p>Mark Johsnon ⭐⭐⭐⭐ </p>
<blockquote><i>"This excursion was one my family and I will never forget. We learned so much about the caves
and got to explore them on our own.  The food provided was great and my family of picky eaters could all find something
they liked.  The photos the travel guides took were great and I will cherish them forever."</i> </blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"I went on the Ajanta Cave Adventure with my husband and we had a great time.  The tour guides were
helpful and kind.  The only complaint I have is the bus we took there was not very nice and did not have a lot of room.
The photos the staff took were amazing quality and I love them !!"</i></blockquote>
