        <!--here are the biography paragraphs-->
        <p>Stephanie Kwolek was an American chemist.  She was a pioneer in polymer research
        whose work yielded the ultrastrong and thick material, or 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevlar" target="_blank"> Kevlar</a>. 
         This material is used in bulletproof vests and has saved many lives. </p><br />
         
        <p> Stephanie was born in New Kensington, PA.  Sadly, her father died when she was 10.
        Her mother raised her and her brother alone.  In 1946, she she received a Bachelor of 
        Science degree in chemistry from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, now known as 
        <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank"> Carnegie Mellon University</a>.  
        She eventually wanted to go to medical school, but she went to work as a laboratory chemist 
        at the rayon department of the 
        <a href="http://www.dupont.com/" target="_blank"> DuPont Company</a>
         in Buffalo, New York.  The DuPont company was responsible for the invention of the
          popular fabric, nylon.

          Synthetic fibers became very popular, so Kwolek became engaged
        in basic research in a new field.  Because the field grew very fast, she never left the DuPont company. She
        moved to the company's Pioneering Research Laboratory in Wilmington, Delaware in 1950.  She retired with
        the rank of research associate in 1986.  She accumulate many awards and patents in her career and continued
        as a consultant and public speaker after retirement.  </p>
