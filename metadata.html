<!--Here is a description of the trip. -->
<p>For a week in July this summer, I visited Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.  We stayed at a 
resort that had a pool, beach, water park, restaurants, and shops.  My favorite part of the resort was the beach and pool. 
 While we were there, we went snorkeling and tubing.  I love snorkeling and seeing all of the fish was really cool. I really enjoyed spending
 time with my family and seeing a new place.  I would definitely recommend a vacation to Punta Cana if you can't decide where to go.  The beach and weather is amazing. 
 You will love it!
